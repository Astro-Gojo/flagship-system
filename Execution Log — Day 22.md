Execution Log — Day 22

Date: Day 22
Focus: Adaptation, identity stability, system intelligence under change
Mode: Exam-aware / Low-power execution

✅ Tasks Completed


Part 1:

-Core concept reviewed and understood: Systems must adapt without losing identity.


Part 2 – Task A:

-Analyzed consequences of a system refusing to adapt.

-Key understanding:

*Non-adaptive systems stagnate.

*They become fragile when inputs exceed original design.

*Intelligence remains capped; failure probability increases under change.


Part 3 – Task B:

-Interpreted principle:

“An intelligent system changes its intensity, not its identity.”

-Applied both:

*Systems perspective: core logic remains constant, execution scales.

*Personal analogy: values and direction remain fixed, effort output adapts to constraints (exams, fatigue).


Part 4:

-Deferred structured reflection to GitHub for revision and continuity.
