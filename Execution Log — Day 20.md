Day 20 — Stability vs Progress

Key Insight:
A system that prioritizes speed over stability becomes unreliable due to rapid state flickering and uncontrolled transitions.

Learned that:
- Stability prevents noise amplification
- Fast reactions without verification break systems
- Mature systems pause intentionally before acting

Rule of the Day:
“A mature system knows when to pause and when to act.”

Status:
Day completed under controlled workload.
Zero-day streak maintained.
