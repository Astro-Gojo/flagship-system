Execution Log — Day 4-B (actually day 5)

Project: Flagship System — Python Sensor-Light Simulation.

Activities:

-Learned functions in Python (def) and how to return values.

-Created get_sensor_value() to simulate hardware sensor input.

-Created decide_light_state(sensor_value) to make decisions based on sensor readings (ON, DIM, OFF).

-Created display_status(sensor_value, light_state) to print the results.

-Learned main() function as the program’s entry point for clean execution.

-Refactored code to remove duplicate function calls and handle randomness correctly.

-Observed output changes due to new random sensor values each run.

-Gained understanding of function responsibilities, modular code, and program structure.

Outcome/Learnings:

-Mastered basic function definition, calling, and return values.

-Understood program organization with main().

-Learned simulation of hardware input using Python’s random module.


-Observed the importance of modular code for readability, maintainability, and scaling.
