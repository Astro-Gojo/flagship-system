Day 33 — System States & Mode Switching

Studied the concept of system operating modes and understood the importance of switching states based on external conditions. Reflected on the risks of forcing a single mode under changing pressures and identified my current operating state as recovery, transitioning toward stabilization. Established awareness of deliberate mode transitions to maintain long-term system resilience.
