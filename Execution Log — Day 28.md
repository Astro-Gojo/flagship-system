Execution Log — Day 28

Day: 28
Focus: System boundaries & identity
Key Learnings:

-Boundaries define what the system is responsible for

-Lack of boundaries causes noise intake and control loss

-A system must reject inputs as actively as it accepts them

-Stability depends more on clarity than capability

Rules Reinforced:

-A system must know what it will not do

-Identity is protected by boundaries

-Unlimited openness leads to failure, not strength

Status: ✅ Completed
