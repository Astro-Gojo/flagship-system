Execution Log — Day 23 – Controlled Throughput

Core insight:
High-performance systems do not operate at maximum capacity continuously. They regulate throughput to maintain stability.

Learnings:
- Sustained overload leads to resource depletion and system failure.
- Multitasking and excessive input reduce accuracy and momentum.
- Limiting throughput preserves stability and long-term performance.

Rule:
A high-performance system limits throughput to protect stability.

Personal application:
Sleep is my current bottleneck. Improving rest is necessary to maintain consistency during exams and learning.
