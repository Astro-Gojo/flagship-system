**Day 64 — Execution Log**



**Review**

* Clarified what count++ means.
* Understood non-atomic read-modify-write.
* Reinforced mutex vs spinlock behavior.



**New Understanding**

* Syntax-level simplicity ≠ CPU-level simplicity.
* Threads share memory → instruction interleaving risk.



Energy Level (estimate)

Probably < 5.

But showed mental clarity.
