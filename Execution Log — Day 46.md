Day 46 — Control System Consolidation



Objective:

Reinforce core control-system principles without introducing new complexity.



Key Concepts Reviewed:



* State-based decision making



* Role of time in preventing false transitions



* Why blocking delays (sleep()) are unsafe in control systems



* Difference between slow systems and dead systems



Key Takeaways:



* Time validates signal stability, not just value correctness



* Control systems must remain aware even when not acting



* Responsiveness matters more than raw speed



Outcome:

Concepts stabilized and mental model consolidated for future expansion.
