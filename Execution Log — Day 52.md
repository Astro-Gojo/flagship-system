Day 52 — State-Aware Throttling

Focus:
Learning when and how to deliberately reduce load without breaking system continuity.

Key Concepts:
- The body provides hard signals (fatigue, eye twitching, cognitive strain) that must be treated as system limits, not excuses.
- Ignoring limits leads to silent degradation, not immediate failure.
- Intelligent systems throttle performance to preserve long-term functionality.

Execution:
- Identified current physical state accurately.
- Chose the smallest viable action to maintain the main quest.
- Avoided overwork while keeping consistency intact.

Outcome:
Main quest continued.
System protected.
No recovery debt added.
