DAY 31 — SYSTEM IDENTITY CHECK

Insight:
A system must preserve its core identity under pressure.
Short-term survival that compromises identity leads to long-term failure.

Task A:
When a system sacrifices its core identity to survive pressure, it becomes confused,
loses its original purpose, and settles into a form it was never designed for.

Task B:
“A system that abandons its core to cope with pressure eventually becomes a stray.”

Rule Applied Today:
Preserve identity, reduce intensity.

Status:
System intact under exam load.
Continuity maintained.
