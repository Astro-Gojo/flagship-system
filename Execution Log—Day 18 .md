Day 18 — Execution Log

Focus: System sustainability & recovery as a designed state.

Key Learning:

-Continuous ACTIVE state increases error probability.

-Humans and systems are limited by physical, mental, and biological constraints.

-Recovery is required to restore reliability and maintain long-term performance.

Insight:

-Treating recovery as laziness is a design flaw.

-Recovery is a state with rules, not absence of work.

Core Rule Logged:

“Recovery is not optional; it is a designed state.”

Status:

-Main task completed.

-Side quest deferred intentionally (GitHub business-core repo created to maintain streak).


-No zero day achieved.
