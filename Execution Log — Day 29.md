Day 29 — Systems Thinking Log

Focus:
Understanding boundaries vs limits in system design.

Key Learnings:
- A boundary defines what a system is responsible for.
- A limit defines how much a system can safely handle.
- Boundaries preserve system identity; limits preserve system survival.
- Ignoring limits causes degradation and failure even if boundaries are respected.

Insight:
A system can stay aligned with its purpose yet still fail if it exceeds its capacity.

Rule Reinforced:
Healthy systems enforce limits deliberately to protect longevity.
