Day 27 – Execution Log

Focus:
Understanding system limits, responsibility creep, and disciplined growth.

Key Learnings:
- Knowing system limits prevents catastrophic failure.
- Systems that expand without redefining states lose clarity and stability.
- Growth without refinement leads to fragile, noisy systems.

Core Insight:
A strong system does not do more — it does clearer.

Status:
Day 27 completed.
Streak intact.
