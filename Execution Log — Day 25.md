Day 25 — Execution Log

Focus: System sustainability & recovery awareness

Core Insight:
A system that operates continuously without recovery will degrade in performance, make incorrect decisions, and eventually fail.

Key Learnings:

-Continuous operation without rest leads to system breakdown.

-Sustainable systems deliberately schedule recovery, not just execution.

-Lower intensity on high-load days preserves long-term functionality.

Reflection:
Today’s work emphasized maintaining system health over pushing intensity. Choosing reduced load ensured continuity without burnout, aligning with long-term goals.

Status:
✅ Zero Day maintained
✅ Concept understood
✅ System integrity preserved
