Phase: 1 — Foundation + Momentum
Micro-Task: Simulated Sensor Input → Output

1. Objective

Understand the input → process → output flow in a system.

Create a tiny functional module of the flagship system using Python simulation.

2. Tools Used

-Python 3

-Text editor / IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or any)

3. Steps Taken

-Chose a simulated sensor (light sensor) with random values between 0–100.

-Wrote a Python script to read the “sensor” value.

-Added processing rules:

   *IF sensor_value < 50 → Lights ON

   *ELSE → Lights OFF
 
-Printed output to console to observe behavior.

4. Output Observed
| Sensor Value | Action     |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| 23           | Lights ON  |
| 87           | Lights OFF |
| 45           | Lights ON  |


5. Reflections / Notes

-Input → process → output cycle is now clear in practice.

-Module simulates hardware + software interaction even without physical hardware.

-Logging outputs shows system behavior for later analysis and proof-of-work.

-Next step: integrate multiple rules / conditions, expand system scope.

6. Challenges / Questions

-Need to learn Python basics more deeply to handle more complex logic.

-How to log multiple readings efficiently (file/database) next.

✅ Conclusion

-First functional system module created.

-Proof-of-work logged and ready for GitHub.

-Simulation allows starting system-building without hardware.
