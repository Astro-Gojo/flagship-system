Day 24 Execution Log:
Focus: System boundaries and self-regulation

Learned:
- Systems fail when boundaries between states/components are unclear
- Strong systems enforce limits to prevent error propagation
- Boundaries increase stability, recoverability, and longevity

Key Principle:
"A well-designed system protects itself by enforcing boundaries."

Status:
Main quest continued under exam constraints.
Zero-day protocol maintained.
