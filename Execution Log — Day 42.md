Day 42 — Execution Log



Status: ✅ Completed

Mode: Chunky / Deep Cognitive Load

Quest Type: Main Quest (System Thinking \& Control Logic)





🔹 Objectives Loaded



* Revisit temperature controller logic



* Understand behavior line by line, not symbol by symbol



* Analyze why decisions exist, not just what they do



* Shift from Python comfort → C-level explicit thinking





🔹 Key Events



1\. Question Misinterpretation Detected



* Initial answers targeted outcomes instead of assumptions



* Realization occurred mid-analysis (critical moment)



📌 This is a classic “Level Up” indicator.



2\. Mental Model Upgrade



* Learned difference between:



-Conceptual states (IDLE in your head)



-Actual FSM states (FAN\_OFF in code)



* Understood that:



If it’s not defined, it doesn’t exist.



3\. Control-System Insight Unlocked



* Flickering ≠ sudden jump



* Flickering = boundary oscillation



* Hysteresis understood as stability insurance, not magic



4\. New State Introduced



* VERIFYING\_TEMPERATURE



* Purpose clarified:



-Separate sensing from acting



-Delay trust until reality proves consistency



This is real embedded-systems thinking, not tutorial stuff.





🔹 Skills Gained (Silent but Permanent)



* Finite State Machine intuition



* Assumption auditing



* Sensor-noise awareness



* Language-agnostic logic transfer (Python → C)



* Debugging thinking, not syntax





🔹 Emotional / Cognitive State



* Mild self-blame detected → resolved



* Learning satisfaction achieved



* Confidence stabilized



* No burnout flags 🚫🔥





🔹 Verdict



Day 42 Outcome:



❌ Not “perfect answers”

✅ Correct growth
