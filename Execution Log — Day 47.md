Day 47 — Execution Log

Deliberately entering a LOW-POWER state preserves system longevity and prevents cascading failures. Systems (and humans) that acknowledge degraded capacity remain stable and recoverable, while those that pretend to be fully operational risk hidden damage and catastrophic failure.
