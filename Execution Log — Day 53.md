# Day 53 — Event Awareness

## Concept
Studied why event-driven systems are more responsive and efficient than delay-based loops.

## Key Insight
A system does not need to run constantly to be alive — it needs to be aware and ready to react.

## Engineering Takeaway
Event-driven design allows systems to conserve resources while remaining instantly responsive, whereas delay-based loops introduce blindness, wasted cycles, and missed events.

## Status
Main quest continued. No zero day.
