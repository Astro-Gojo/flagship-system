# Day 8 – System Thinking & Control Flow

## What I Worked On
- Understood data flow vs control flow using both code and real-world analogies
- Reflected on how software systems mirror real-life systems
- Practiced breaking a system into inputs, logic, outputs, and control

## Key Learnings

### Data Flow
- Data is the information a system uses to make decisions
- In code: sensor values flow through functions and get transformed
- In real life: food provides data (nutrients) which the body processes

### Control Flow
- Control flow decides **when** and **what** runs next
- In code: main(), function calls, conditions
- In real life: brain, habits, triggers, decisions

## System Example – Gym
- Input: food, energy, time
- Decision Logic: weight selection, exercise choice
- Output: fatigue, muscle stimulus, mental clarity
- Control Flow: personal decisions and routines

## Reflection
Today was more about thinking than writing code.
This helped me understand how programs and real-world systems are structured similarly.
