# Day 57 — Determinism

## Concept
Studied why determinism is critical in embedded and hardware-aware systems.

## Key Insight
Embedded systems interact with physical hardware, where timing and predictability directly affect safety and reliability.

## Engineering Takeaway
Non-deterministic behavior in embedded systems can cause real-world failure, not just software inconvenience.

## Status
Micro session complete.
Streak preserved.
