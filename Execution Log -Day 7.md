Execution log Day 7 – System Thinking & Layered Understanding

Today focused on deep understanding rather than new code.

Key learnings:
- Clearly identified system components: input, decision logic, output
- Understood the role of functions and main() in controlling execution flow
- Realized variables like `sensor` and `state` are just placeholders for data passed between functions
- Explored system failure scenarios (sensor failure, noisy data, scaling to multiple sensors)
- Learned that hardware failures appear as bad data in software
- Strengthened understanding of layered system design (hardware → interface → logic)

No new code added.
Significant improvement in conceptual clarity and systems thinking.
