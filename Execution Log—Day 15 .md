Day 15 — Execution Log

Focus: Temporal behavior & system stability

Key Concepts Learned:

-Systems must consider time, not just instantaneous input

-Difference between stable states and transitional states

-VERIFYING as a confidence-building state

-Importance of avoiding premature state transitions

-Noise tolerance in real-world systems

New Mental Models Acquired:

-Stability over correctness

-Consistency over single truth

-Calm systems outperform reactive systems

Tasks Completed:

-Analyzed VERIFYING state requirements

-Identified dangers of single-sample decisions

-Defined stabilization rule for noisy input

-Articulated reliability philosophy of systems

Outcome:

-System design thinking elevated from reactive logic to temporal reasoning

-Readiness to implement filters, counters, and guarded transitions in future designs
