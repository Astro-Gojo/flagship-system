# Execution Log — Day 3

## Objective
Extend the simulated system to handle multiple sensor inputs and combined decision logic.

## What I Built
- Simulated a light sensor (0–100)
- Simulated a temperature sensor (20–40)
- Created a combined rule using both values
- Generated system output based on conditions

## Input → Process → Output
- Input: Light value, Temperature value
- Process: Conditional logic using both inputs
- Output: System action (Light/Fan ON or OFF)

## Observations
- System behavior changes dynamically each run
- Multiple inputs increase realism
- Logic feels closer to real-world automation

## Status
Day 3 complete. No zero day maintained.
