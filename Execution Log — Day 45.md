Day 45 — EXECUTION LOG



Main Quest



* Topic: Time-aware logic in control systems



* Learned:



\-Delay vs timer (blocking vs non-blocking)



\-Time as a confidence filter



\-Time-based state transitions



* Mental shift achieved:



\-From “reacting to values”



\-To “reacting to values sustained over time”





Cognitive Wins:



* Correctly identified blocking behavior risk



* Understood timers as logic, not pauses



* Connected system design to personal regulation (high-level abstraction)





Corrections Applied:



* Clarified timer-reset starvation bug



* Distinguished noise problems from logic bugs





Status:



* ✅ Main quest COMPLETE



* 🔒 Concept locked



* 🧠 Load appropriate for a chunky session



* ❌ No side quests required today
