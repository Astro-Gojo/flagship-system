Day 48 — Control Systems: Awareness over Reaction



* Consolidated understanding that real control systems operate on value + state + time, not raw input alone.



* Learned why reacting instantly to current input (“now”) causes instability:



\-In machines: noise, flickering, false transitions.



\-In humans: impulsive decisions, poor long-term outcomes.



* Reinforced the idea that context and temporal filtering are essential for stable behavior.



* Focused on minimum viable progress under time constraints, prioritizing system health over volume.



Status: Main quest completed (micro session, intentional).
