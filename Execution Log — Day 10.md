Day 10 — System Layering & Control Flow Thinking

Focus:
- Understanding software as layered systems instead of linear scripts

Learned Concepts:
- Input Layer: Where data enters the system (sensor / simulated sensor)
- Processing Layer: Decision logic using conditional rules
- Control Layer: main() as the orchestrator of execution flow
- Output Layer: Displaying system state for observability

Key Insights:
- Replacing a fake sensor with real hardware only affects the input layer
- main() controls execution order and prevents unintended re-execution
- Layered design enables scalability and hardware independence

Outcome:
- Improved system-level thinking
- Clear separation of responsibilities across layers
- Stronger foundation for future hardware, AI, and multi-sensor expansion
