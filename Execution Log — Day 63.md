Day 63 — Execution Log (Main Quest)

Topic: Threads vs Processes (Deeper Layer)

What I understood today:

* Threads share memory.
* Processes have separate memory.
* Threads are lighter than processes.
* Thread context switch is cheaper.
* Spinlock vs Mutex difference (spinning vs sleeping).



Core Clarifications Added:

* Process creation = new address space + page tables + kernel structures.
* Thread creation = new stack + registers + metadata.

* Shared memory is why threads need synchronization.

* Isolation is why processes are safer.



Mental Upgrade Today: moved from intuitive answers → structural reasoning.

That’s real progress.
