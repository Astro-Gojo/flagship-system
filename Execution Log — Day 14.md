Day 14 – State-Based Thinking

Focus:
- Shifted from if-else logic to state-based system design
- Understood states as persistent conditions with entry and exit rules

Key Learnings:
- A system remains in a state until explicit transition conditions are met
- Decisions trigger transitions; states maintain behavior
- Input changes alone should not force state changes
- States improve stability and safety as system complexity increases

Work Done:
- Defined ON state with entry, behavior, exit, and transition paths
- Differentiated between decision logic and state architecture
- Learned why state-based thinking prevents flicker and instability

Status:
- Conceptual foundation established for real-world system design
