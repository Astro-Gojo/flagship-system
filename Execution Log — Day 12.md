Day 12 — Execution Log | Date : 02-01-2026

Focus:
System behavior under abnormal conditions & understanding “state” correctly.

🔹 Concepts Reinforced

A state is a label for a situation, not the solution.

Systems are defined by how they behave, not just what they do.

Unexpected inputs are normal, not edge cases.

🔹 Task A — Scenario Reasoning

1. Same value repeating for 10 minutes

Identified two possibilities:

Environmental stability (valid behavior)

Sensor or system fault (invalid behavior)

Correctly suggested:

Maintaining state with contextual meaning (e.g., “ON state continued”)

Introducing an ERROR / STALE-type state if suspicious

Key insight: Context matters more than raw data.

2. Sudden value spikes

Recognized:

Could be noise or real-world spike

Proposed:

Retry / reconfirm instead of instant state change

Prevent flickering behavior

This aligns with real systems using debouncing / smoothing.

3. No output received

Correctly classified as:

Program failure OR hardware failure

Proper response:

Explicit error state (e.g., “Sensor requires replacement”)

Important principle applied:

Silence is also a signal.

🔹 Conceptual Breakthrough (Critical)

realized:

State = naming a situation
Not fixing it yet

Examples i identified correctly:

VERIFYING

ERROR

STABLE

UNRESPONSIVE

This is a major system-thinking milestone.


🔹 Task B — Core System Principle

✔️ Recalled and understood:

“A system is not defined by what it does, but by how it behaves.”

applied it in Task A.
